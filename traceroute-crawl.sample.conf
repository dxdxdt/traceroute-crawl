# IPv6 prefix to use for the fun
# Usually the one assigned to the instance from the cloud provider. The host's
# IPv6 address probably needs to be configured manually so that it doesn't
# collide with the PREFIX.
# Note that the addresses are generated using string op. No real parsing and
# arithmetic calculation of the addresses is done when used to add netns so make
# sure it is valid and ends with a colon(:).

# Prefix length used to purge the records

# The lines to put in PTR records
# Things to consider
#  - Traceroute command only shows up to 30 hops by default
#  - The max TTL or hop limit value is 255. Leave room for routers on internet
#  - Hetzner has wrong FQDN validation regex. Trial and error needed to find
#    what sort of names are possible
